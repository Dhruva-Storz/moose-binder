    "These are models that illustrate different aspects of Chemical Bistable and Oscillatory systems. The notebooks are quite self-explanatory. They can be used to teach concepts, gain an intuitive understanding of them, or learn how to model the systems they describe.\n",

    "Viewing the models as jupyter notebooks adds a level of interactivity to them. The text at the beginning of each model outlines a few things you can change in the model. Once youre done changing the code, you can hit ``Run`` or ``SHIFT+ENTER`` to execute it, as you might have done in the quickstart section.\n",
